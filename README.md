#About me
I am a junior high school student in Japan.I like programming.

But it's a shame.
I can't speak and write English well.

I'm using deepl all the time as I write this. It might be strange English.
I am not even sure what I am writing about. 

Maybe I'm not a good programmer, to be honest.
So, I would appreciate it if you don't give me any grief about my English.

*Forgive me if this may be offensive writing.*
