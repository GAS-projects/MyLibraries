__Be sure to read this before using the libraries!__

# About me
I am a junior high school student in Japan.I like programming.

__But it's a shame. I can't speak and write English well.__

I'm using deepl all the time as I write this. It might be strange English.

I am not even sure what I am writing about. 

Maybe I'm not a good programmer, to be honest. So, I would appreciate it if you don't give me any grief about my English.

__Forgive me if this may be offensive writing.__

# About the libraries
I have to preface this with a long story.

This repository literally contains libraries.　<- This is made by deepl too.

But they will all be of poor quality and useless. 

__But for me, who finds pleasure in writing code, this is just a hobby.__

Everyone should snicker at the code I am writing. lol.

# Finally

I'll put up a link to the deepl I used to create this README.

deepl・・・<a href = https://www.deepl.com/ja/translator>Click this link</a>

Not sure how often this repository is updated.
